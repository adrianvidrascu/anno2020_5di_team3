**Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project):** 

The owners of agricultural lands that will benefits from the web application will be able to manage their fields in a simpler and more orderly way, being able to make the calculation of the agricultural yield in an easy and fast way.

________________

**Goals and Objectives**: 

The project will be a web application with accounts where you can view your agricultural lands.    Calculation of the agricultural yield of a field knowing: 

- The surface 
- The geographic location 
- The seed that will be cultivated.

__________

**Schedule Information:**

- 05/01/2020 - Pre-Project Documentation
-  gg/mm/yyyy - Creation of the site
- gg/mm/yyyy – Creation of the DB Account and the log in functionality
- gg/mm/yyyy - Adding the personal area of the site(DB field)
- gg/mm/yyyy – Creation of the DB Seeds 
- gg/mm/yyyy – Adding the formula of agricultural yield 
- gg/mm/yyyy – Adding the geographic position variable

________________

**Financial Information:**

The estimated initial project budget is around € 15000, if you exceed the initial budget you can extend up to a maximum of € 20000.

_________

**Project Proprieties and degrees of freedom:**

Have a version of the project where you can log in with your username and views the lands in your possessions, manage them and be able to calculate the yield of the field with a given seed, based on the size of the field, quantity of seeds used and them geographical positions (other possible variables: fallow ...).

__________

**Approach:**

Creation of a stable web application with the calculation based on the size of the field, and then the possibility to add more and more specifications for an increasingly precise calculation of the yield of the field.

________________

**Constraints:**

The web application will not have a market prediction.

____________

**Assumptions:**

You will have a database of seeds that will be obtained from the internet. The web application will have a database of accounts associated with lands, the users will be able to manage his own fields and calculate the yield of all of them.

_________________

**Success Criteria:**

The web application will be declared complete when, once the yield of the field has been calculated, a realistic result will be calculated.

___________

**Scope:**

The application will have a graphical interface that will help the user with the calculation of the probable agricultural yield.

___________

**Risks and obstacles to success:**

The inability to predict the future in the meteorological and earnings area.                                                          Plants could get sick, insect migration and birds.
