### Defects

At this time, defects that were found were labeled as incidents.  Many of what we consider defects were self made defects that were hard to find but easy to correct. Incidents were found that had the opportunity of turning into defects in the system had they not been able to be corrected.

### Summary

The testing procedure to date has been conducted using manual system testing and concurrent unit testing.  Features tested include but are not limited to:

- Ability to add/remove users of the system (back-end) as needed

  â€‹	Test case: 4.3.4.1, 4.3.4.2

Further system testing will be done as newly implemented features become available.  These features include all the functionality of the Administration Page which entails adding users.
